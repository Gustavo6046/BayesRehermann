# BRCCS - Bayes-Rehermann Conversational Classification System

Inspired by Markov chains and using naive Bayes classifiers,
this system is a conversational response system for generative
chatbots.

The name comes from two facts:

* the model was designed by Gustavo R. Reherman
  (Gustavo6046);

* the model utilizes mainly naive Bayes classification to
  achieve what it needs.

It works by classifying every input sentence I's feature set,
with a response word index T, into the predicted output word
at the index T. Once T is larger than the predicted output's
length, it should return None.
  
This is a technology developed by Gustavo6046, and as such,
falls under the clauses of the MIT License for source code.
